a:T4f7,Text‑to‑image models are rapidly advancing into creative practice and increasingly support generating illustrated storybooks, i.e., sequential and image‑based narratives conditioned on written text. Previous surveys have examined challenges in video coherence or single‑image fidelity; however, no comprehensive review addresses the unique requirements of storybook illustration. This survey fills this gap by grounding AI‑illustrated storybook generation in a narratology framework. Specifically, it introduces a six‑dimensional consistency model encompassing time, space, character, event and plot, style and theme. For each dimension the authors consolidate definitions, representative methods, datasets and evaluation metrics, mapping the current landscape of the field. Building on this analysis they further identify cross‑dimensional failure modes and limitations of current approaches. Finally, the survey proposes potential future research directions, including the development of book‑scale integrated evaluation systems tailored for illustrated storybooks, more robust and controllable generation pipelines, enhanced multimodal semantic–visual alignment mechanisms and the establishment of reader‑oriented safety and educational guidelines.b:T6d2,@article{lin2026narratology,

}d:T479,Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-4 have demonstrated impressive capabilities in various generative tasks. However, their performance is often hampered by limitations in accessing and leveraging long-term memory, leading to specific vulnerabilities and biases, especially during long interactions. This paper introduces ChatLogic, an innovative framework specifically targeted at LLM reasoning tasks that can enhance the performance of LLMs in multi-step deductive reasoning tasks by integrating logic programming. In ChatLogic, the language model plays a central role, acting as a controller and participating in every system operation stage. We propose a novel method of converting logic problems into symbolic integration with an inference engine. This approach leverages large language models' situational understanding and imitation skills and uses symbolic memory to enhance multi-step deductive reasoning capabilities. Our results show that the ChatLogic framework significantly improves the multi-step reasoning capabilities of LLMs. The source code and data are available at https://github.com/Strong-AI-Lab/ChatLogice:T70c,@inproceedings{wang2024chatlogic,
